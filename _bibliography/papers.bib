  abstract= {Label smoothing -- using softened labels instead of hard ones -- is a widely adopted regularization method for deep learning, showing diverse benefits such as enhanced generalization and calibration. 
  Its implications for preserving model privacy, however, have remained unexplored. To fill this gap, we investigate the impact of label smoothing on model inversion attacks (MIAs), 
  which aim to generate class-representative samples by exploiting the knowledge encoded in a classifier, thereby inferring sensitive information about its training data. 
  Through extensive analyses, we uncover that traditional label smoothing fosters MIAs, thereby increasing a model's privacy leakage. Even more, we reveal that smoothing with negative factors counters this trend, 
  impeding the extraction of class-related information and leading to privacy preservation, beating state-of-the-art defenses. This establishes a practical and powerful novel way for enhancing model resilience against MIAs.},

  abstract= {The proliferation of large AI models trained on uncurated, often sensitive web-scraped data has raised significant privacy concerns. One of the concerns is that adversaries can extract information about the training data using privacy attacks. 
  Unfortunately, the task of removing specific information from the models without sacrificing performance is not straightforward and has proven to be challenging. We propose a rather easy yet effective defense based on backdoor attacks to remove private information 
  such as names and faces of individuals from vision-language models by fine-tuning them for only a few minutes instead of re-training them from scratch. Specifically, by strategically inserting backdoors into text encoders, 
  we align the embeddings of sensitive phrases with those of neutral terms--``a person'' instead of the person's actual name. For image encoders, we map individuals' embeddings to be removed from the model to a universal, anonymous embedding. 
  The results of our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of our backdoor-based defense on CLIP by assessing its performance using a specialized privacy attack for zero-shot classifiers. Our approach provides a new ``dual-use'' 
  perspective on backdoor attacks and presents a promising avenue to enhance the privacy of individuals within models trained on uncurated web-scraped data.},

  critical area of research. Whereas prior studies have focused on privacy risks in single-modal models, we introduce a novel method to

  reveals whether an individual was included in the training data by querying the model with images of the same person. Letting the model 
  choose from a wide variety of possible text labels, the model reveals whether it recognizes the person and, therefore, was used for training. 
  Our large-scale experiments on CLIP demonstrate that individuals used for training can be identified with very high accuracy. We confirm that 
  the model has learned to associate names with depicted individuals, implying the existence of sensitive information that can be extracted by 
  adversaries. Our results highlight the need for stronger privacy protection in large-scale models and suggest that IDIAs can be used to prove 
  the unauthorized use of data for training and to enforce privacy laws.},

  In this paper, we present a guide that moves toward a standard approach in evaluating a base generative AI system for any modality in two overarching categories: what can be evaluated in a base system independent of context and what can be evaluated in a societal context. 
  Importantly, this refers to base systems that have no predetermined application or deployment context, including a model itself, as well as system components, such as training data. Our framework for a base system defines seven categories of social impact: bias, stereotypes, 
  and representational harms; cultural values and sensitive content; disparate performance; privacy and data protection; financial costs; environmental costs; and data and content moderation labor costs. Suggested methods for evaluation apply to listed generative modalities 
  and analyses of the limitations of existing evaluations serve as a starting point for necessary investment in future evaluations. We offer five overarching categories for what can be evaluated in a broader societal context, each with its own subcategories: trustworthiness and autonomy; 
  inequality, marginalization, and violence; concentration of authority; labor and creativity; and ecosystem and environment. Each subcategory includes recommendations for mitigating harm.},

  We introduce backdoor attacks against text-guided generative models and demonstrate that their text encoders pose a major tampering risk. Our attacks only slightly alter an encoder so that no suspicious model behavior is apparent for image generations with clean prompts. 
  By then inserting a single character trigger into the prompt, e.g., a non-Latin character or emoji, the adversary can trigger the model to either generate images with pre-defined attributes or images following a hidden, potentially malicious description.

  abstract={Approximate matching is a well-known concept in digital forensics to determine the similarity between digital artifacts.  
  An important use case of approximate matching is the reliable and efficient detection of case-relevant data structures on a blacklist 
  (e.g., malware or corporate secrets), if only fragments of the original are available. For instance, if only a cluster of indexed malware is 
  still present during the digital forensic investigation, the approximate matching algorithm shall be able to assign the fragment to the blacklisted 
  malware.  However, traditional approximate matching functions like TLSH and ssdeep fail to detect files based on their fragments if the presented 
  piece is relatively small compared to the overall file size (e.g., like one-third of the total file). A second well-known issue with traditional 
  approximate matching algorithms is the lack of scaling due to the ever-increasing lookup databases.  In this paper, we propose an improved matching 
  algorithm based on transformer-based models from the field of natural language processing.  We call our approach Deep Learning Approximate Matching 
  (DLAM). As a concept from artificial intelligence, DLAM gets knowledge of characteristic blacklisted patterns during its training phase.  
  Then DLAM is able to detect the patterns in a typically much larger file, that is DLAM focuses on the use case of fragment detection.  
  Our evaluation is inspired by two widespread blacklist use cases:  the detection of malware (e.g., in JavaScript) and corporate secrets 
  (e.g., pdf or office documents).  We reveal that DLAM has three key advantages compared to the prominent conventional approaches TLSH and ssdeep. 
  First, it makes the tedious extraction of known to be bad parts obsolete, which is necessary until now before any search for them with approximate 
  matching algorithms. This allows efficient classification of files on a much larger scale, which is important due to exponentially increasing data 
  to be investigated.  Second, depending on the use case, DLAM achieves a similar (in case of mrsh-cf and mrsh-v2) or even significantly higher accuracy 
  (in case of ssdeep and TLSH) in recovering fragments of blacklisted files. For instance, in the case of JavaScript files, our assessment shows that 
  DLAM provides an accuracy of 93\% on our test corpus, while TLSH and ssdeep show a classification accuracy of only 50\%. 
  Third, we show that DLAM enables the detection of file correlations in the output of TLSH and ssdeep even for fragment sizes, 
  where the respective matching function of TLSH and ssdeep fails.},

    effect on model interpretability. To stabilize MoE training, we present both soft and hard constraint-based approaches. 
    With hard constraints, the weights of certain experts are allowed to become zero, while soft constraints balance the contribution of 
    experts with an additional auxiliary loss. As a result, soft constraints handle expert utilization better and support the expert 
    specialization process, while hard constraints maintain more generalized experts and increase overall model performance. 
    Our findings demonstrate that experts can implicitly focus on individual sub-domains of the input space. For example, 
    experts trained for CIFAR-100 image classification specialize in recognizing different domains such as flowers or animals without 
    previous data clustering. Experiments with RetinaNet and the COCO dataset further indicate that object detection experts can also

    pdf={https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12179.pdf},
    abstract={Model inversion attacks (MIAs) aim to create synthetic images that reflect the class-wise characteristics from a target 
      classifier's private training data by exploiting the model's learned knowledge. Previous research has developed generative MIAs 
      that use generative adversarial networks (GANs) as image priors tailored to a specific target model. 
      This makes the attacks time- and resource-consuming, inflexible, and susceptible to distributional shifts between datasets. 
      To overcome these drawbacks, we present Plug & Play Attacks, which relax the dependency between the target model and image prior, 
      and enable the use of a single GAN to attack a wide range of targets, requiring only minor adjustments to the attack. 
      Moreover, we show that powerful MIAs are possible even with publicly available pre-trained GANs and under strong distributional shifts, 
      for which previous approaches fail to produce meaningful results. Our extensive evaluation confirms the improved robustness and 
      flexibility of Plug & Play Attacks and their ability to create high-quality images revealing sensitive class characteristics.},

  abstract={Apple recently revealed its deep perceptual hashing system NeuralHash to detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on user devices 
    before files are uploaded to its iCloud service. Public criticism quickly arose regarding the protection of user privacy and the system’s reliability. 
    In this paper, we present the first comprehensive empirical analysis of deep perceptual hashing based on NeuralHash. 
    Specifically, we show that current deep perceptual hashing may not be robust. An adversary can manipulate the hash values by applying 
    slight changes in images, either induced by gradient-based approaches or simply by performing standard image transformations, 
    forcing or preventing hash collisions. Such attacks permit malicious actors easily to exploit the detection system: from hiding abusive material 
    to framing innocent users, everything is possible. Moreover, using the hash values, inferences can still be made about the data stored on user devices. 
    In our view, based on our results, deep perceptual hashing in its current form is generally not ready for robust client-side scanning and should not 
    be used from a privacy perspective.},

    pdf={https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.09076.pdf},
    abstract={Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a specific sample was used to train a predictive model. 
      Knowing this may indeed lead to a privacy breach. Most MIAs, however, make use of the model's prediction scores - 
      the probability of each output given some input - following the intuition that the trained model tends to behave differently on its training data. 
      We argue that this is a fallacy for many modern deep network architectures. Consequently, MIAs will miserably fail since overconfidence leads 
      to high false-positive rates not only on known domains but also on out-of-distribution data and implicitly acts as a defense against MIAs. 
      Specifically, using generative adversarial networks, we are able to produce a potentially infinite number of samples falsely classified as 
      part of the training data. In other words, the threat of MIAs is overestimated, and less information is leaked than previously assumed. 
      Moreover, there is actually a trade-off between the overconfidence of models and their susceptibility to MIAs: the more classifiers know 
      when they do not know, making low confidence predictions, the more they reveal the training data.},

  abstract={Regulators around the world try to stop the distribution of digital criminal content without circumventing the
    encryption methods in place for confidential communication. One approach is client-side scanning (CSS) which checks the
    content on the user’s device for illegality before it is encrypted and transmitted. Apple has recently revealed a client-side deep
    perceptual hashing system called NeuralHash to detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on user devices before the images
    are encrypted and uploaded to its iCloud service. After its public presentation, criticism arose regarding the users’ privacy and the
    system’s reliability. In this work, we present an empirical analysis of client-side deep perceptual hashing based on NeuralHash.
    We show that such systems are not robust, and an adversary can easily manipulate the hash values to force or prevent
    hash collisions. Such attacks permit malicious actors to exploit the detection system: from hiding abusive material to framing
